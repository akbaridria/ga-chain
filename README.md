# Ga-Chain

Ga-Chain is a blockchain project that provides a data layer for decentralized applications (DApps) to access information about various assets and transactions on the blockchain. The project aims to enable developers to easily query and visualize blockchain data.

Ga-Chain uses Google Cloud Platform as its underlying technology to index and store data related to various blockchain transactions and assets.
Using Google Cloud Platform as the technology to index blockchain data provides several advantages for Ga-Chain. Like Google Cloud Platform is a highly scalable and reliable platform that can handle large amounts of data and traffic. This means that Ga-Chain can easily handle the high throughput of data generated by ZkSync and other blockchain.

Here are the list of technology that we use on google cloud platform
- Google BigQuery : to store blockchain data
- Google Cloud Function : to store the script that we use to index blockchain data
- Google Cloud Scheduler : cron job cloud function (script) to index blockchain data every minutes
- Google cloud storage : to store temporary json file to batch load into bigquery
